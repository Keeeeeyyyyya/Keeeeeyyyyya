Hi, I'm Khushi Mosem, an enthusiastic and driven Electronics and Communication Engineering student with a keen interest in technology and innovation. I am passionate about exploring the intersection of electronics, software, and data analysis.

I have hands-on experience working on various projects, including IoT-based systems, solar panel installations, and data analytics using Power BI. Additionally, I’ve designed a wearable antenna using CST software, and I am currently working on a research paper related to antenna design. I also enjoy building simple yet engaging projects, such as a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python and data analysis projects using tools like Excel and Power BI.

Currently, I am honing my skills in VLSI Design, Embedded Systems, and AI, and I love exploring creative ways to apply these technologies to solve real-world problems. Alongside my technical work, I have actively participated in art-related events, NGO volunteering, and college activities, where I’ve contributed both creatively and organizationally.

I am always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to meaningful projects. Feel free to explore my repositories, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you want to collaborate or chat about technology and innovation!
